It allows the users to search for jobs using their desired search terms from all over the internet. It also allows users to click on the job posts showing inside the feeds or search results and navigate throught the details of each job posting. Moreover, it allows users to apply on a particular job by clicking a 'Apply for job' button on the job details page. | <img src="https://github.com/SaeedRafay/job-search-mobileapp/blob/main/react-native-job-search-mobileapp-preview.gif" width="300">
